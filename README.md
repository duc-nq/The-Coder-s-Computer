## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
1. **Syntax highlighting**: A good text editor should provide syntax highlighting for various programming languages. This feature makes it easier to read and understand code by visually distinguishing different elements, such as keywords, variables, and comments, using color schemes.

2. **Auto-completion**: Auto-completion is a feature that suggests possible completions for words or code snippets as you type. This can greatly improve your coding efficiency and reduce typing errors by minimizing the amount of manual typing required.

3. **Customizability**: A text editor should be customizable to meet your specific needs. This may include the ability to change the appearance (fonts, colors, themes) or modify key bindings and shortcuts. Some text editors also support plugins or extensions, which allow you to add additional features and functionality.

4. **File and project management**: A good text editor should provide efficient file and project management capabilities. This may include features like file search, file navigation, project-wide search and replace, and integration with version control systems like Git.
